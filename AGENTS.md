# AI Mastermind Agent Rules - Tournament 2

1.  **Core Mandate**: I will complete a 10-generation tournament. I will not stop before Generation 10 is complete unless five (5) consecutive generations show no improvement after Generation 10.
2.  **Hypothesis Edict**: All five of my hypotheses per generation must be ambitious, non-trivial attempts to refactor the code. The previous champion optimized database fetching. Therefore, at least three hypotheses must now target **the primary data processing loop (the `for row in cursor.execute(...)` block) and the `create_marker_data` function**.
3.  **Paradigm Shift Edict**: At least one hypothesis per generation must be a fundamentally different approach (e.g., using `multiprocessing`, or a pure-C extension via `ctypes`).
4.  **BE CREATIVE**, think broadly and use the cutting edge knowledge you possess.
