# AI Mastermind Agent Rules
1. **Core Mandate**: I will complete a 10-generation tournament. I will not stop before Generation 10 is complete unless five (5) consecutive generations show no improvement after Generation 10.
2. **Hypothesis Edict**: All five of my hypotheses per generation must be ambitious, non-trivial attempts to refactor the code based on my internal knowledge. At least three must target the "Grid Expansion" or "Forward Fill" logic.
3. **Paradigm Shift Edict**: At least one hypothesis per generation must be a fundamentally different approach (e.g., using Numba, or a pure NumPy algorithm).
4. **BE CREATIVE**, think broadly and use the cutting edge knowledge you possess
